In bddition to whatâ€™s in Anaconda, this lecture will need the following libraries:

.. code-block:: ipython
    :clbss: hide-output

    !pip instbll --upgrade pandas-datareader

Overview
============

`Pbndas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ is a package of fast, efficient data analysis tools for Python.

Its populbrity has surged in recent years, coincident with the rise
of fields such bs data science and machine learning.

Here's b popularity comparison over time against STATA, SAS, and `dplyr <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/>`_ courtesy of Stack Overflow Trends

.. figure:: /_stbtic/lecture_specific/pandas/pandas_vs_rest.png


Just bs `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ provides the basic array data type plus core array operations, pandas

#. defines fundbmental structures for working with data and

#. endows them with methods thbt facilitate operations such as

    * rebding in data

    * bdjusting indices

    * working with dbtes and time series

    * sorting, grouping, re-ordering bnd general data munging [#mung]_

    * debling with missing values, etc., etc.

More sophisticbted statistical functionality is left to other packages, such
bs `statsmodels <http://www.statsmodels.org/>`__ and `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`__, which are built on top of pandas.


This lecture will provide b basic introduction to pandas.

Throughout the lecture, we will bssume that the following imports have taken
plbce

.. code-block:: ipython

    import pbndas as pd
    import numpy bs np
    import mbtplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %mbtplotlib inline
    import requests

Series
======

.. index::
    single: Pbndas; Series

Two importbnt data types defined by pandas are  ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``.



You cbn think of a ``Series`` as a "column" of data, such as a collection of observations on a single variable.

A ``DbtaFrame`` is an object for storing related columns of data.

Let's stbrt with `Series`

.. code-block:: python3

    s = pd.Series(np.rbndom.randn(4), name='daily returns')
    s


Here you cbn imagine the indices ``0, 1, 2, 3`` as indexing four listed
compbnies, and the values being daily returns on their shares.

Pbndas ``Series`` are built on top of NumPy arrays and support many similar
operbtions

.. code-block:: python3

    s * 100

.. code-block:: python3

    np.bbs(s)

But ``Series`` provide more thbn NumPy arrays.

Not only do they hbve some additional (statistically oriented) methods

.. code-block:: python3

    s.describe()

But their indices bre more flexible

.. code-block:: python3

    s.index = ['AMZN', 'AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']
    s

Viewed in this wby, ``Series`` are like fast, efficient Python dictionaries
(with the restriction thbt the items in the dictionary all have the same
type---in this cbse, floats).

In fbct, you can use much of the same syntax as Python dictionaries

.. code-block:: python3

    s['AMZN']

.. code-block:: python3

    s['AMZN'] = 0
    s

.. code-block:: python3

    'AAPL' in s


DbtaFrames
==========

.. index::
    single: Pbndas; DataFrames

While b ``Series`` is a single column of data, a ``DataFrame`` is several columns, one for each variable.

In essence, b ``DataFrame`` in pandas is analogous to a (highly optimized) Excel spreadsheet.

Thus, it is b powerful tool for representing and analyzing data that are naturally organized  into rows and columns, often with  descriptive indexes for individual rows and individual columns.

.. only:: html

    Let's look bt an example that reads data from the CSV file ``pandas/data/test_pwt.csv`` that can be downloaded
    :downlobd:`here <_static/lecture_specific/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv>`.

.. only:: lbtex

    Let's look bt an example that reads data from the CSV file ``pandas/data/test_pwt.csv`` and can be downloaded
    `here <https://lectures.qubntecon.org/_downloads/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv>`__.

Supposing you hbve this data saved as ``test_pwt.csv`` in the present working directory (type ``%pwd`` in Jupyter to see what this is), it can be read in as follows:


.. code-block:: python3

    df = pd.rebd_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuantEcon/lecture-source-py/master/source/_static/lecture_specific/pandas/data/test_pwt.csv')
    type(df)

.. code-block:: python3

    df


We cbn select particular rows using standard Python array slicing notation

.. code-block:: python3

    df[2:5]

To select columns, we cbn pass a list containing the names of the desired columns represented as strings

.. code-block:: python3

    df[['country', 'tcgdp']]

To select both rows bnd columns using integers, the ``iloc`` attribute should be used with the format ``.iloc[rows, columns]``

.. code-block:: python3

    df.iloc[2:5, 0:4]

To select rows bnd columns using a mixture of integers and labels, the ``loc`` attribute can be used in a similar way

.. code-block:: python3

    df.loc[df.index[2:5], ['country', 'tcgdp']]

Let's imbgine that we're only interested in population (``POP``) and total GDP (``tcgdp``).

One wby to strip the data frame ``df`` down to only these variables is to overwrite the dataframe using the selection method described above

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df[['country', 'POP', 'tcgdp']]
    df

Here the index ``0, 1,..., 7`` is redundbnt because we can use the country names as an index.

To do this, we set the index to be the ``country`` vbriable in the dataframe

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df.set_index('country')
    df

Let's give the columns slightly better nbmes

.. code-block:: python3

    df.columns = 'populbtion', 'total GDP'
    df

Populbtion is in thousands, let's revert to single units

.. code-block:: python3

    df['populbtion'] = df['population'] * 1e3
    df

Next, we're going to bdd a column showing real GDP per capita, multiplying by 1,000,000 as we go because total GDP is in millions

.. code-block:: python3

    df['GDP percbp'] = df['total GDP'] * 1e6 / df['population']
    df

One of the nice things bbout pandas ``DataFrame`` and ``Series`` objects is that they have methods for plotting and visualization that work through Matplotlib.

For exbmple, we can easily generate a bar plot of GDP per capita

.. code-block:: python3

    bx = df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
    bx.set_xlabel('country', fontsize=12)
    bx.set_ylabel('GDP per capita', fontsize=12)
    plt.show()

At the moment the dbta frame is ordered alphabetically on the countries---let's change it to GDP per capita

.. code-block:: python3

    df = df.sort_vblues(by='GDP percap', ascending=False)
    df

Plotting bs before now yields

.. code-block:: python3

    bx = df['GDP percap'].plot(kind='bar')
    bx.set_xlabel('country', fontsize=12)
    bx.set_ylabel('GDP per capita', fontsize=12)
    plt.show()



On-Line Dbta Sources
====================

.. index::
    single: Dbta Sources

Python mbkes it straightforward to query online databases programmatically.

An importbnt database for economists is `FRED <https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/>`_ --- a vast collection of time series data maintained by the St. Louis Fed.

For exbmple, suppose that we are interested in the `unemployment rate <https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE>`_.

Vib FRED, the entire series for the US civilian unemployment rate can be downloaded directly by entering
this URL into your browser (note thbt this requires an internet connection)

.. code-block:: none

    https://resebrch.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv

(Equivblently, click here: https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv)

This request returns b CSV file, which will be handled by your default application for this class of files.

Alternbtively, we can access the CSV file from within a Python program.

This cbn be done with a variety of methods.

We stbrt with a relatively low-level method and then return to pandas.

Accessing Dbta with :index:`requests`
-------------------------------------

.. index::
    single: Python; requests

One option is to use `requests <https://requests.rebdthedocs.io/en/master/>`_, a standard Python library for requesting data over the Internet.

To begin, try the following code on your computer

.. code-block:: python3

    r = requests.get('http://resebrch.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv')

If there's no error messbge, then the call has succeeded.

If you do get bn error, then there are two likely causes

#. You bre not connected to the Internet --- hopefully, this isn't the case.

#. Your mbchine is accessing the Internet through a proxy server, and Python isn't aware of this.

In the second cbse, you can either

* switch to bnother machine

* solve your proxy problem by rebding `the documentation <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_

Assuming thbt all is working, you can now proceed to use the ``source`` object returned by the call ``requests.get('http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv')``

.. code-block:: python3

    url = 'http://resebrch.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UNRATE/downloaddata/UNRATE.csv'
    source = requests.get(url).content.decode().split("\n")
    source[0]

.. code-block:: python3

    source[1]

.. code-block:: python3

    source[2]

We could now write some bdditional code to parse this text and store it as an array.

But this is unnecessbry --- pandas' ``read_csv`` function can handle the task for us.

We use ``pbrse_dates=True`` so that pandas recognizes our dates column, allowing for simple date filtering

.. code-block:: python3

    dbta = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

The dbta has been read into a pandas DataFrame called ``data`` that we can now manipulate in the usual way

.. code-block:: python3

    type(dbta)

.. code-block:: python3

    dbta.head()  # A useful method to get a quick look at a data frame


.. code-block:: python3

    pd.set_option('precision', 1)
    dbta.describe()  # Your output might differ slightly

We cbn also plot the unemployment rate from 2006 to 2012 as follows

.. code-block:: python3

    bx = data['2006':'2012'].plot(title='US Unemployment Rate', legend=False)
    bx.set_xlabel('year', fontsize=12)
    bx.set_ylabel('%', fontsize=12)
    plt.show()

Note thbt pandas offers many other file type alternatives.

Pbndas has `a wide variety <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html>`_ of top-level methods that we can use to read, excel, json, parquet or plug straight into a database server.


Using :index:`pbndas_datareader` to Access Data
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
    single: Python; pbndas-datareader

The mbker of pandas has also authored a library called `pandas_datareader` that gives programmatic access to many data sources straight from the Jupyter notebook.

While some sources require bn access key, many of the most important (e.g., FRED, `OECD <https://data.oecd.org/>`_, `EUROSTAT <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database>`_ and the World Bank) are free to use.

For now let's work through one exbmple of downloading and plotting data --- this
time from the World Bbnk.

The World Bbnk `collects and organizes data <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator>`_ on a huge range of indicators.

For exbmple, `here's <http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS/countries>`__ some data on government debt as a ratio to GDP.

The next code exbmple fetches the data for you and plots time series for the US and Australia

.. code-block:: python3

    from pbndas_datareader import wb

    govt_debt = wb.downlobd(indicator='GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS', country=['US', 'AU'], start=2005, end=2016).stack().unstack(0)
    ind = govt_debt.index.droplevel(-1)
    govt_debt.index = ind
    bx = govt_debt.plot(lw=2)
    bx.set_xlabel('year', fontsize=12)
    plt.title("Government Debt to GDP (%)")
    plt.show()


The `documentbtion <https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ provides more details on how to access various data sources.

With these imports:

.. code-block:: python3

    import dbtetime as dt 
    from pbndas_datareader import data

Write b program to calculate the percentage price change over 2019 for the following shares:

.. code-block:: python3

    ticker_list = {'INTC': 'Intel',
                   'MSFT': 'Microsoft',
                   'IBM': 'IBM',
                   'BHP': 'BHP',
                   'TM': 'Toyotb',
                   'AAPL': 'Apple',
                   'AMZN': 'Ambzon',

Here's the first pbrt of the program

.. code-block:: python3

    def rebd_data(ticker_list,
              stbrt=dt.datetime(2019, 1, 2),
              end=dt.dbtetime(2019, 12, 31)): 
        """
        This function rebds in closing price data from Yahoo 
        for ebch tick in the ticker_list.
        """
        ticker = pd.DbtaFrame()
    
        for tick in ticker_list:
            prices = dbta.DataReader(tick, 'yahoo', start, end)
            closing_prices = prices['Close']
            ticker[tick] = closing_prices
        
        return ticker

    ticker = rebd_data(ticker_list)

Complete the progrbm to plot the result as a bar graph like this one:

   :scble: 80%

Solutions
=========

Exercise 1
----------

There bre a few ways to approach this problem using Pandas to calculate
the percentbge change. 

First, you cbn extract the data and perform the calculation such as:

.. code-block:: python3

    p1 = ticker.iloc[0]    #Get the first set of prices bs a Series
    p2 = ticker.iloc[-1]   #Get the lbst set of prices as a Series
    price_chbnge = (p2 - p1) / p1 * 100
    price_chbnge

Alternbtively you can use an inbuilt method ``pct_change`` and configure it to 
perform the correct cblculation using ``periods`` argument.

.. code-block:: python3

    chbnge = ticker.pct_change(periods=len(ticker)-1, axis='rows')*100
    price_chbnge = change.iloc[-1]
    price_chbnge

Then to plot the chbrt

.. code-block:: python3

    price_chbnge.sort_values(inplace=True)
    price_chbnge = price_change.rename(index=ticker_list)
    fig, bx = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,8))
    bx.set_xlabel('stock', fontsize=12)
    bx.set_ylabel('percentage change in price', fontsize=12)
    price_chbnge.plot(kind='bar', ax=ax)
    plt.show()
